Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently developed by Google, based on the 
Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using t
ouch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping 
and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text 
input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for
 televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a 
 specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks,
 game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.<br><br>
 

Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems of any kind.
 Android has been the best selling OS on tablets since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.
 <br><br>
 Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007
 , along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance – a consortium of hardware, software,
 and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.
 As of July 2013, the Google Play store has had over one million Android applications
 ("apps") published, and over 50 billion applications downloaded. An April–May 2013
 survey of mobile application developers found that 71% of developers create applications 
 for Android, and a 2015 survey found that 40% of full-time professional developers
 see Android as their priority target platform, which is comparable to Apple's 
 iOS on 37% with both platforms far above others.At Google I/O 2014, the
 company revealed that there were over one billion active monthly Android users,
 up from 538 million in June 2013.

Android's source code is released by Google under open source licenses, although
 most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software, 
 including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular
 with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable
 operating system for high-tech devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large
 community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation 
 for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced users or bring
 Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. At the same time, 
 as Android has no centralised update system most Android devices fail to receive 
 security updates: research in 2015 concluded that almost 90% of Android phones in use
 had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support.
 The success of Android has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called 
 "smartphone wars" between technology companies.

<br>
Google was not the creator of the Android OS. In fact, Android was developed by Android Inc.
 in Palo Alto, California. The company was founded in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner,
 Nick Sears and Chris White. They originally intended to develop an operating system for digital
 cameras. However, when they realized that the digital camera market was not big enough, they
 switched to a smartphone operating system to compete with Symbian and Windows Mobile while Apple 
 iPhone had not been released at the time. In the same year, Andy Rubin ran out of money so on August 17,
 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. After the acquisition, Google still retain they key employees of 
 Android Inc., including Rubin, Miner and White. Since that time Android is 
 rapidly growing and developing its mobile device platform.
