<p id="new">
Android is developed in private by Google until the latest changes and updates 
are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available 
publicly. This source code will only run without modification on select devices,
 usually the Nexus series of devices. The source code is, in turn, adapted by OEMs 
 to run on their hardware. Android's source code does not contain the often proprietary 
 device drivers that are needed for certain hardware components.
 <br><br>

<p id="new">In 2007, the green Android logo was designed for Google by a graphic designer Irina Blok
. The design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon
 with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design. After numerous design
 developments based on science-fiction and space movies, the team eventually sought 
 inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a 
 robot shape. As Android is open-sourced, it was agreed that the logo should be likewise,
 and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design.

<div id="subh">THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY</div>
<br>
<p id="new">
Android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) 
source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system.
 These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster
 than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality;
 provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring
 Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the
 HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided
 by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor.
 CyanogenMod is the most widely used community firmware, and acts as a foundation for numerous others.
 There have also been attempts with varying degrees of success to port Android to iPhones, notably the iDroid Project.
<br><br>
<p id="new">
Historically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party
 firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running 
 unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this. Moreover, modified firmwares such
 as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as tethering, for which carriers would otherwise
 charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted
 access to root permissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed software
 has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United 
 States that permits the "jailbreaking" of mobile devices, manufacturers and carriers have 
 softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including HTC, Motorola,
 Samsung and Sony, providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time 
 the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an 
 increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar 
 to Nexus series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices' warranties to do so.
 However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down,
 frustrating developers and customers.

<div id="subh">LINUX KERNAL</div>
<br>
<p id="new">
Android's kernel is based on one of the Linux kernel's long-term support (LTS) branches.
 Since April 2014, Android devices mainly use versions 3.4 or 3.10 of the Linux kernel.
 The specific kernel version depends on the actual Android device and its hardware platform;
 Android has used various kernel versions since the version 2.6.25 that was used in Android 1.0.
 <br><br>

Android's variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by 
Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle, such as the inclusion of components like
 Binder, ashmem, pmem, logger, wakelocks, and different out-of-memory (OOM) handling
 Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel, notably a power management
 feature called "wakelocks", were rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they 
 felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code. Google announced in April 2010
 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community, but Greg Kroah-Hartman,
 the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned
 that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux. Some Google 
 Android developers hinted that "the Android team was getting fed up with the process," because they
 were a small team and had more urgent work to do on Android.
 <br><br>

In August 2011, Linus Torvalds said that "eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel,
 but it will probably not be for four to five years".In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced
 the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features
 back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks
 capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the 
 same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory 
 (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop).
 Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android
 off the latest stable Linux versions.

<p id="new">
The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system for
 the operating system itself, and /data for user data and application installations.
 In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access
 to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system are read-only. However, root 
 access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the
 open-source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices,[128] but also by malicious
 parties to install viruses and malware.
 <br><br>

Android is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation, Google's open-source chief Chris DiBona,
 and several journalists. Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that Android 
 is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not
 include the GNU C Library (it uses Bionic as an alternative C library) and some of other
 components typically found in Linux distributions.
 <br><br>
</p></P>
<div id="subh">SOFTWARE STACK</div>
<br>
<p id="new">
On top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C,
 and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible
 libraries based on Apache Harmony. Development of the Linux kernel continues
 independently of other Android's source code bases.
<br><br>
Until version 5.0, Android used Dalvik as a process virtual machine with trace-based just-in-time
 (JIT) compilation to run Dalvik "dex-code" (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from
 the Java bytecode. Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to interpreting the
 majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select
 frequently executed code segments ("traces") each time an application is launched.
 Android 4.4 introduced Android Runtime (ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses ahead-of-time
 (AOT) compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the 
 installation of an application. In Android 4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled
 by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.

<br><br>
<p id="new">
Android's standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android,
 as a derivation of the BSD's standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed 
 with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using 
 Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint,
 and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed under the 
 terms of the BSD licence, which Google finds more suitable for the Android's overall licensing model.
 <br><br>

Aiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012 Google switched
 the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.
 <br><br>

Android does not have a native X Window System by default, nor does it support the full 
set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications
 or libraries to Android, until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought
 support for applications written completely in C or C++. Libraries written in C may also
 be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the JNI.
