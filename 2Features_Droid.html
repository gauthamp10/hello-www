<p>Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, 
using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping,
 tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along
 with a virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards
 are supported via Bluetooth or USB. The response to user input is designed 
 to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration
 capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware,
 such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications
 to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait
 to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a 
 vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.
<br><br>
Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information "hub"
 on Android devices that is analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. 
 (Android also runs on regular personal computers, as described below). 
 Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons 
 launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such 
 as the weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen.
 A homescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and 
 forth, though Android's homescreen interface is heavily customisable, allowing users to adjust
 the look and feel of the devices to their tastes.Third-party apps available on Google Play
 and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other
 operating systems, such as Windows Phone.Most manufacturers, and some wireless carriers,
 customise the look and feel of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their
 competitors.Applications that handle interactions with the homescreen are called "launchers"
 because they, among other purposes, launch the applications installed on a device.
 <br><br>

Along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device
 and its connectivity. This status bar can be "pulled" down to reveal a notification
 screen where apps display important information or updates, such as a newly received 
 email or SMS text, in a way that does not immediately interrupt or inconvenience the
 user.Notifications are persistent until read by tapping it, which opens the relevant
 app, or dismissed by sliding it off the screen. Beginning on Android 4.1, "expanded notifications"
 can display expanded details or additional functionality; for instance, a music player 
 can display playback controls, and a "missed call" notification provides buttons for 
 calling back or sending the caller an SMS message.
 <br><br>

Android provides the ability to run applications that change the
 default launcher, and hence the appearance and externally visible 
 behaviour of Android. These appearance changes include a multi-page 
 dock or no dock, and many more changes to fundamental features of the user interface.

<br><br>
Android software development and Google Play
Applications ("apps"), which extend the functionality of devices,
 are written using the Android software development kit (SDK) and,
 often, the Java programming language that has complete access to the
 Android APIs. Java may be combined with C/C++, together with a choice 
 of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support; the Go programming 
 language is also supported since its version 1.4, which can also be used exclusively
 although with a restricted set of Android APIs.[66] The SDK includes a comprehensive
 set of development tools, including a debugger, software libraries, a handset 
 emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Initially, Google's
 supported integrated development environment (IDE) was Eclipse using the Android 
 Development Tools (ADT) plugin; in December 2014, Google released Android Studio,
 based on IntelliJ IDEA, as its primary IDE for Android application development. 
 Other development tools are available, including a native development kit (NDK) 
 for applications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visual environment 
 for novice programmers, and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks.
 In January 2014, Google unveiled an framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome 
 HTML 5 web applications to Android, wrapped in a native application shell.

<br>
 Android has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired 
 by users by downloading and installing the application's APK (Android application package) 
 file, or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install,
 update, and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application
 store installed on Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements and
 license the Google Mobile Services software. Google Play Store allows users to browse,
 download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers; as of July 2013,
 there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play Store. As of July 2013,
 50 billion applications have been installed. Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for
 Google Play application purchases, where the cost of the application is added to the user's monthly bill.
<br><br>
Due to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplaces also 
exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship 
with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due
 to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included
 the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and SlideMe. F-Droid, another alternative marketplace, seeks to
 only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.

<div id="subh">Memory management</div>
<br><br>
Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to
 keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends 
 its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it
 does not use battery power or CPU resources.
<br><br>
<center><img src="ram.png"></center>
Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low,
 the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting
 with those that have been inactive for longest. Lifehacker reported in 2011
 that third-party task killers were doing more harm than good.

<br><h1 id="hed">UNIQUE FEATURES</h1></center>
<br><br>
<div id="fe">1) Near Field Communication (NFC)</div>
<br>
Most Android devices support NFC, which allows electronic devices to easily interact across
 short distances. The main aim here is to create a payment option that is simpler than
 carrying credit cards or cash, and while the market hasnt exploded as many experts had 
 predicted, there may be an alternative in the works, in the form of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
<br><br>
<div id="fe">2) Alternate Keyboards</div>
<br><br>
Android supports multiple keyboards and makes them easy to install; the SwiftKey, Skype
, and 8pen apps all offer ways to quickly change up your keyboard style. Other mobile 
operating systems either dont permit extra keyboards at all, or the process to install
 and use them are tedious and time-consuming.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">3) Infrared Transmission</div>
<br><br>
The Android operating system supports a built-in infrared transmitter, 
allowing you to use your phone or tablet as a remote control.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">4) No-Touch Control</div>
<br><br>
Using Android apps such as Wave Control, users can control their phones touch-free,
 using only gestures. Have messy hands but need to turn off your screen or change a
 song? Simple. This could prove especially useful if youre driving,
 so you can keep both eyes on the road.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">5) Automation</div>
<br><br>
The Tasker app lets you not only control app permissions but also automate them.
 Do you only want your location services to be active during the day? Want to
 create a customized way to start your musicfor example, with a voice command 
 and at a certain volume? Tasker can help.
<br><br>

<div id="fe">6) Wireless App Downloads</div>
<br><br>
Accessing app stores on any mobile device can be frustrating, but iOS makes 
it a little more difficultdownload an app on your computer, and it wont sync
 to your mobile device until you plug in and access iTunes. Using the Android Market 
 or third-party options like AppBrain, meanwhile, let you download apps on your 
 PC and then automatically sync them your Droid, no plugging required.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">7) Storage and Battery Swap</div>
<br><br>
Android phones also have unique hardware capabilities. Googles OS makes it possible
 to remove and upgrade your battery or to replace one that no longer holds a charge.
 In addition, Android phones come with SD card slots for expandable storage.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">8) Custom Home Screens</div>
<br><br>
While its possible to hack certain phones to customize the home screen,
 Android comes with this capability from the get-go. Download a third-party 
 launcher like Nova, Apex or Slide and you can add gestures, new shortcuts,
 or even performance enhancements for older-model devices.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">9) Widgets</div>
<br><br>
Apps are versatile, but sometimes you want information at a glance instead
 of having to open an app and wait for it to load. Android widgets let you
 display just about any feature you choose, right on the home screenincluding
 weather apps, music widgets, or productivity tools that helpfully remind
 you of upcoming meetings or approaching deadlines.
<br><br>
<div id="fe">10) Custom ROMs</div>
<br><br>
This is a big one. Because the Android operating system is open source,
 developers can tweak the current OS and build their own versions,
 which users can download and install in place of the stock OS. Some 
 are filled with features, while others change the look and feel of a device
 Chances are if theres a feature you want, someone has already built a custom ROM for it.
