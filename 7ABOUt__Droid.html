<p id="new">Andrew E. "Andy" Rubin (born 1963) is an American computer programmer, engineer, entrepreneur,
 and venture capitalist. He is the founder and CEO of tech startup incubator Playground 
 Global and a partner at venture capital firm Redpoint Ventures. He is the 
 co-founder and former CEO of both Danger Inc. and Android Inc. He was 
 Senior Vice President of Mobile and Digital Content at Google until March 2013,
 where he oversaw development of Android, an open-source operating system for smartphones.
 Rubin has seventeen patents for his inventions.
<br><br>
On 13 March 2013, Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved
 from the Android division to take on new projects at Google.
 He was replaced by Sundar Pichai, who now serves as Google's CEO.
 In December 2013, Rubin was called to manage the robotics division of Google 
 (which includes companies bought by Google, such as Boston Dynamics).
 On 30 October 2014 he left Google after nine years at the company to start an incubator for hardware startups

<div id="subh">LICENSING</div>
<br>
<p id="new">
The source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google,
 with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released.
 Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under
 the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution.
 The license does not grant rights to the "Android" trademark, so device manufacturers and
 wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated
 Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2,
 developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times
 . Typically, Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device
 (part of the Nexus series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code
 available after that device has been released. The only Android release which was not 
 immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. 
 The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was 
 because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom, and they did not
 want third parties creating a "really bad user experience" by attempting to put 
 onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.

<p id="new">
Only the base Android operating system (including some applications) is open-source software, 
whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software, 
such as Google Mobile Services, which includes applications such as Google Play Store,
 Google Search, and Google Play Services – a software layer that provides APIs for the
 integration with Google-provided services, among others. These applications must be 
 licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet
 its compatibility guidelines and other requirements. Custom, certified distributions
 of Android produced by manufacturers (such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) may also 
 replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add 
 additional software not included in the stock Android operating system.There may also be 
 "binary blob" drivers required for certain hardware components in the device.
 <br><br>
</P>
<p id="new">
Some stock applications in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android,
 such as Search, Music and Calendar, have been abandoned by Google in favor of non-free 
 replacements distributed through Play Store (Google Search, Google Play Music, and Google Calendar)
 that are no longer open-source. Moreover, open-source variants of some applications also 
 exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions, such as Photosphere panoramas
 in Camera, and a Google Now page on the default home screen (exclusive to the proprietary 
 version "Google Now Launcher", whose code is embedded within that of the main Google application).
 <br><br>
 </P>
<p id="new">
Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android
and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant, because drivers
 and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary
 , and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or deinstall
 applications and, as a result, invite non-free software.
